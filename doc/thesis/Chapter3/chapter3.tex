\section{Implementation}

\textbf{Frontier} is the programmatic output for this part of the project...
providing an API-like interface to the data itself... ...allowing simple
commands to pull the data out from memory in to formats acceptable by the machine
learning framework...

...provides a class to read from the "bamcheckr'd files" as seen in
Appendix~\ref{app:bamcheckr}... as well as the auto\_qc output matrix briefly
demonstrated in Appendix~\ref{app:aqc_matrix}...

...a major refactoring to remove hard-coded classes from \textbf{Frontier} which
enable it to be used as a more general purpose tool; if we were to add another
class label, the definition would merely need to be included to the CLASSES
(Listing~\ref{fig:FrontierClasses}) variable passed when the Statplexer is
constructed. But use is therefore not merely limited to our problem but rather
any machine learning problem where you'd like to simplify your interactions
which a very large dataset.

Takes 5.5s on average, 16.1s with ratio due to inefficient implementation
for overlapping\_base\_duplicate\_percentage
re-wrote in Python...


...R CMD BATCH issue

...Fixed a graph plotting failure.
...Writing additional routines...

\subsection{SelectKBest}
* incorect degrees of freedom
* warnings: /usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/sklearn/feature\_selection/univariate\_selection.py:256: RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in divide, causing NaN
* Replaced univariate\_selection with version from master
* needed use force np.float64
...actually data was 0... gg :(
