\subsection{Data Collection and Format}

%NOTE Assuming lanelets have been described by this point...
%TODO samtools stats actually generates this data rather than "the seq process"
As part of the project I've been granted access to significant data sets at the
Sanger Institute, unlocking quality control data for two of the largest studies
currently undergoing analysis. A wide array of quality metrics are available for
each and every lanelet that forms part of either of the two studies; totalling
13,455 files.

%9154 (68\%), 1542 (11\%), 2759 (21\%)...

%TODO Citation for samtools?
%TODO Explain a BAM file
The files are created by \textbf{samtools stats} --- part of a collection of
widely used open-source utilities for post processing and manipulation of large
alignments such as those produced by next-generation sequencers that are
released under the umbrella name of "SAMtools" (Sequence Alignment and Map
Tools). \textbf{samtools stats} collects statistics from sequence data files %BAM
and produces key-value summary numbers as well as more complex tab delimited
dataframes tabulating several metrics over time.

%TODO Was samtools stats known as bamcheck, or did it replace it?
The output of \textbf{samtools stats} is then parsed by an in-house tool called
\textbf{bamcheckr}, named so as \textbf{samtools stats} was once known as
\textbf{bamcheck} and the tool is written in R. \textbf{bamcheckr} supplements
the summary numbers section of the \textbf{samtools stats} output with
additional metrics that are later used by \textbf{auto\_qc} for classification.
This process does not change the file other than adding a few additional
key-value pairs in the summary numbers section. An truncated example of a 
"bamcheckr'd" file can be found in Appendix~\ref{AppendixA}.
