Introduction

Introduction and Background

Over the past few years advances in genetic sequencing hardware have introduced the concept of massively
parallel DNA sequencing; allowing potentially billions of chemical reactions to occur simultaneously, reducing
both time and cost required to perform genetic analysis[2]. However, these "next-generation" processes are
complex and open to error[1], thus quality control is an essential step to assure confidence in any downstream
analyses performed.

1.2

Description

During sample sequencing a large number of quality control metrics are generated to determine the quality
of the reads from the sequencing hardware itself. At the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, the automated QC
system currently relies on hard thresholds to make such quality control decisions with individual hard-coded
values on particular metrics determining whether a lane has reached a level that requires a warning, or has
exceeded the threshold and failed entirely. Whilst this does catch most of the very poor quality lanes, a large
number of lanes are flagged for manual inspection at the warning level; a time consuming task which invites
inefficiency and error.
In practise most of these manual decisions are based on inspecting a range of diagnostic plots which
suggests that a machine learning classifier could potentially be trained on the combinations of quality control
statistics available to make these conclusions without the need for much human intervention.
